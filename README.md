## Project Overview
Telecommunication companies face increasing challenges in retaining customers due to market competition and changing consumer preferences. By analyzing customer data, such as demographics, service usage, contract type, and payment methods, these companies aim to identify patterns associated with churn. Understanding these patterns allows telecom providers to develop targeted strategies to reduce churn rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize service offerings, ultimately driving sustainable growth and maintaining a competitive advantage in the dynamic telecom industry.

## Business Understanding

### Problem Statement
Telecommunications companies face substantial revenue loss from high customer churn rates. Without understanding the factors driving churn through customer behavior and service data, they struggle to implement effective retention strategies, leading to higher acquisition costs and reduced profitability.

##  Objectives
### Main Objectives
To identify predictable patterns in customer behavior and service usage that indicate a higher likelihood of churn, enabling Syriatel to implement targeted strategies for customer retention and reduce revenue loss from customer attrition

###  Specific Objectives
Identify and segment customers who are most likely to churn based on their usage patterns, service history, and engagement levels
Determine the key drivers of customer dissatisfaction by analyzing customer service interactions, complaints, and feedback, and develop initiatives to improve overall service quality and satisfaction.
come up with strategies that will reduce customer's service calls by addressing common issues affecting their customers
Develop machine learning models that will predict wether a customer will churn or not

### Success Metrics
Accuracy â€“ The proportion of correctly predicting wether a customer will churn or not 85% - 90%

Precision - 80%.

Recall - 80-90%

###  StakeHolders
Customers: The primary stakeholders whose behavior and satisfaction directly impact churn rates

Marketing Team: Responsible for developing and implementing strategies to attract and retain customers

Finance Team: Monitors the financial impact of churn on revenue and profitability

Customer Service Team: Handles customer interactions and support


### Constraints
Choosing the Right Metrics: Different stakeholders may prefer different evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC). Balancing these can be tricky, especially with imbalanced data.

The churn column has class imbalance that might affect the modelling process where the models learn so well on the majority class than the minority class

##  Modelling
Processes I will use in the modelling process:

Data Preprocessing: One hot encoding and label encoding and scaling the data

I will do train test split where I will split the adta into train an test size where the test size is 0.2.

I will start with the baseline models

## Preprocessing

Train Test Split

## Models
### Logistic Regression Model

### KNN Model
